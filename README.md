# The "Fork Off" Public License

- Are you an author of cost-free open-source software?
- Are you tired of assholes in your inbox asking for this, that, and the other?
- Are you tired of even _nice_ people in your inbox?
- Are you tired of feature requests with no patches attached?
- Are you tired of being asked for ETAs on open issues?
- Are you tired of *filing* issues?
- Are you tired of software licenses and determining compatibility between
  them?
- ARE YOU JUST TIRED?!

Presenting: the "Fork Off" Public License, wherein you can encourage folks to
spend their own time and effort maintaining software for free, instead!

## Howdy from the author

This is obviously a joke license, please enjoy it as such, and ideally, use it
only as a dual-license alongside some real license of your choosing (I
recommend CC0-1.0, ISC, or MPL-2.0, for copyfree, permissive, and copyleft,
respectively). I hope it makes you laugh just a little as you delete spammers
and trollers from your IRC room... and your inbox... and you contemplate a life
[shoveling pig shit on a farm](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2F-DItXtZs),
far from any computers, ever again. Thank you for sharing your work and your
art with the world, and I hope you continue to do so - and that your work
outlives your maintainership of it in some fork, somewhere!
